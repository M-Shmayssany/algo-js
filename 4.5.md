# Exercise 4.5 algo-js
## 2D distence calculator

this code is a 2D distence calculator  between two points $A[ x_{1} , y_{1}]$ and $B[x_{2} , y_{2}]$.

### Distance Formula:

The distance between two points is the length of the path connecting them. The shortest path distance is a straight line. In a 2 dimensional plane, the distance between points $(X_{1}, Y_{1})$ and $(X_{2}, Y_{2})$ is given by the Pythagorean theorem: 

$$ d = \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^2 + (y_{2}-y_{1})^2} $$

### Calculate Distance

To calculate the distance between 2 points, (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2), for example, (5, 6) and (-7,11), we plug our values into the distance formula: 

$$ d = \sqrt{(-7-5)^2 + (11-6)^2} $$

combining terms inside parentheses we get:

$$ d = \sqrt{(-12)^2 + (5)^2} $$

squaring both terms we get:

$$ d = \sqrt{144 + 25} $$

adding the 2 results,

$$ d = \sqrt{169} $$
$$ d = 13 $$

#### The function in javascript.

1. ```calcDistance(a, b)``` is a function to calculeite the **distance** of an givin two 2D points using the formula .

```
function calcDistance(a,b){
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a[1]- b[1], 2) + Math.pow(a[0]- b[0], 2));
}
```

2. ```calcDistance(a, b)``` the (a, b) is the argument to input the two array of the 2D points.

3. ```Math.sqrt()``` it's a method for represanting the **square root**__ $\sqrt{x} $.

4. ```Math.pow()``` it's a method for represanting the **to the power of**__ $x^y$.

this an exercise 4.5 on functions in javascript.
